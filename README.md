# **Car Insurance Claim Prediction**

This project leverages machine learning to predict the likelihood of car insurance claims based on customer and policy data. By analyzing historical patterns, the model helps insurance companies assess risk, optimize policy pricing, and reduce potential losses. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluation using metrics like accuracy and ROC-AUC to ensure robust and reliable predictions

## **Key Features:**

- **Problem Overview:** The objective is to predict whether a customer will file an insurance claim based on historical data and policyholder information.
- **Dataset:** Utilizes a dataset containing customer demographics, vehicle details, policy information, and past claim history.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implements classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to identify potential claimants.
- **Feature Engineering:** Includes preprocessing steps like handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and creating meaningful derived features.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Measures model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score.
- **Business Impact:** Helps insurance providers predict claims efficiently, reduce fraudulent claims, optimize pricing strategies, and enhance customer experience.

This project demonstrates how data-driven approaches can streamline decision-making in the insurance domain, benefiting both the company and its customers.
